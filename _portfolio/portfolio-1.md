There is renewed interest in heliospheric physics following the recent exploration of the pristine solar wind by the Parker Solar Probe. Magnetic switchback structures are frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, but there are open questions about their origin. Many researchers are investigating the statistical properties of switchbacks and their relationships with wave modes, stream types and solar activity, but the sources of switchbacks remain elusive. Here we report that interplanetary switchbacks originate from magnetic reconnection on the Sun that occurs at chromospheric network boundaries and launch solar jet flows. We link in situ interplanetary measurements and remote-sensing solar observations to establish a connection between interplanetary switchbacks and their solar source region, featuring solar jets, chromospheric network boundaries and photospheric magnetic field evolution. Our findings suggest that joint observations of switchbacks and solar jets provide a better estimate of the contribution of magnetic reconnection to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.

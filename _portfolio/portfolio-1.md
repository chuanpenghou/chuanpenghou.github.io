With the recent exploration of the pristine solar wind by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the origin of magnetic switchback structures, as frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, is becoming one of the cutting-edge science questions in heliospheric physics. Although great endeavors have been undertaken to investigate the statistical properties of switchbacks and their relationship with wave modes, stream types, and solar activity, the sources of switchbacks remain elusive. Here we report that interplanetary switchbacks originate from magnetic reconnections on the sun, which are found to occur at chromospheric network boundaries and launch solar jet flows. Through linking in-situ interplanetary measurements and remote-sensing solar observations, we establish a causal connection between interplanetary switchbacks and their solar source regions, with the latter featuring solar jets, chromospheric network boundaries, and photospheric magnetic-field evolution. Our findings suggest that the joint observations of switchbacks and solar jets provide a more accurate estimate of the contribution of magnetic reconnection on coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.

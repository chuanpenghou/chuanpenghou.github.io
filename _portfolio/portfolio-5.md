By analyzing the magnetosheath measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale Spacecraft, we obtain statistical results for the contribution of magnetic reconnection (MR) events at electron scales to the energy dissipation of coherent structures in shocked turbulent plasmas. The partial variance of increments (PVI) method is employed to find coherent structures in the magnetic field data. We consider criteria to further identify MR events, such as reversal of magnetic field components, significant energy dissipation, and evident electron outflow velocity. Statistically, for most MR events, their PVI values are larger than those of other types of coherent structures, and their energy dissipations are also stronger. However, due to the relatively small number of MR events, their contribution to coherent structures' energy dissipation is relatively trivial. If the dissipation of non-coherent structures is taken into account, MR's contribution to energy dissipation would be even less. Hence, we suggest that MR events, though having strong dissipation locally, are not the major contributor to energy dissipation in the turbulent magnetosheath. After analyzing the features of non-MR current sheets, we propose that these are mainly coherent structures inherent to kinetic Alfvén fluctuations.

SOHO/LASCO C2 can image the space near the sun, but waves of different scales, coronal loops, and solar eruptive activities (such as CMEs) are mixed together in the solar corona, making it extremely difficult to extract wave signals. For one-dimensional time series processing, wavelet transforms can separate wave signals of different periods in the time series. Inspired by this, we propose introducing a two-dimensional space and one-dimensional time (2D+1T) wavelet transform to extract waves propagating in different directions and with different periods from coronal imaging animations. The 2D+1T wavelet transform has previously been applied mainly in the field of moving target recognition. In this work, we have completed the 2D+1T wavelet transform program and developed a graphical user interface (GUI). Through testing, our wavelet transform program has been successfully applied to extract wave signals.

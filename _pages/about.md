I am a PhD Student in Space Physics at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). 

I work on the physics of the solar atmosphere and solar wind mainly through analyzing multiple spacecraft observations and some numerical simulations. This research is of great importance for our understanding of solar systems. 

My current research investigates the origin and evolution of magnetic switchbacks, which play a crucial role in the acceleration and heating processes of interplanetary solar wind. This involves comprehensive analysis of data gathered from in-situ measurement spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, and Wind and remote imaging spacecraft like SOHO and SDO. Through this research, I aim to deepen our understanding of various phenomena occurring in the solar atmosphere, including solar jets, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and the dynamics of magnetic cells, alongside studying the characteristics of the interplanetary solar wind, such as microstreams and switchbacks. You can refer to my publications or contact me directly for further insights.

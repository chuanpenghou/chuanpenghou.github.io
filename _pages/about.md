I am a PhD Student in Space Physics at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
---

My primary research interests lie in solar physics and solar wind physics, focusing on various observational phenomena and employing theories and simulations to interpret observational data. For instance, I am interested in  
* the interaction between the solar corona and solar wind with comets and asteroids,
* the origin and evolution of interplanetary magnetic switchbacks,
* magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the solar corona and inner heliosphere,
* test particle simulations,
* interplanetary scintillation,
* turbulence energy conversion processes in space plasma,
* spatiotemporal wavelet analysis of near-sun disturbances.

Research Approach
---

I analyze publicly available data from in-situ measurement spacecraft (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, and Wind...) and remote imaging spacecraft (SOHO and SDO...), combining theoretical models (such as the Parker solar wind model, coronal magnetic field extrapolation,...), numerical simulations (MHD simulations, test particle simulations), and other suitable methods for related research.

Research Findings

We have found correlations between interplanetary magnetic switchbacks (also known as velocity spikes), solar jets, and coronal brightenings. Further analysis suggests that these switchbacks may originate from magnetic reconnection processes at the boundaries of the chromospheric network.

We compared the properties of switchbacks at different heliocentric distances and concluded that switchbacks exhibit significant energy dissipation near the Sun.

Using test particle simulations, we studied the motion of ionized particles from the tail of the sungrazing comet Lovejoy in the solar corona and found that the morphology of comet tails is modulated by comet velocity and the coronal magnetic field.

We conducted MHD simulations of the interaction between the solar wind and comets/asteroids with different mass loss rates and compared the simulations with in-situ observations from Parker Solar Probe (PSP).

We evaluated the contribution of magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetosheath to turbulence energy dissipation.

We applied 2D spatial + 1D temporal wavelet transform to coronal imaging animations to extract wave information with different periods and wavevectors directly.

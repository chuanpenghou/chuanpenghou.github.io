I am a PhD Student in Space Plasma Physics at Peking University. My work focuses on the physics of the solar atmosphere and solar wind mainly through the analysis of multiple spacecraft observations and some numerical simulations. This research is of great importance for our understanding of solar systems. 
For more details, my current research focuses on the origin and evolution of magnetic switchbacks, which may contribute to the acceleration and heating of interplanetary solar wind. During this research, I need to handle the analysis of in-situ measurement spacecraft (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Wind, ...) and remote imaging spacecraft (SOHO, SDO, Hinode, ...), and multiple activities including in the solar atmosphere (solar jets, CME, the motion of magnetic cells, ...) and the interplanetary solar wind (microstreams, switchbacks, ...). You can find more details about my research here or directly in my list of publications.
